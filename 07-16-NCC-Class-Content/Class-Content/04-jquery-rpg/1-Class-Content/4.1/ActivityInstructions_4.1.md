## Activity - Generating HTML with Plain JS

* **File:**
	* DrinkList_Unsolved.html (2-JSDrinkList)

* **Instructions:**

	* Using the file sent to you as a starting point, add the missing code such that your JavaScript generates HTML content that displays all of the drink options.

	* HINT:  You will need a for-loop. Inside your for loop you will need to use each of the following methods: createElement, innerHTML, and appendChild.

## Activity - Generating HTML with jQuery

* **File:**

	* jQueryDrinkList_Unsolved.html (4-jQueryDrinkList)

* **Instructions:**

	* Re-factor (re-write) your previous drinkList code from earlier, but this time use jQuery to complete all of the same tasks.

	* Your final code should NOT have any of the following methods: `createElement`, `innerHTML`, or `appendChild`.

	* HINT: Don’t forget to “incorporate” jQuery before you begin.

## Activity - Sandwich Clicking

* **File:**
	* SandwichClick_Unsolved.html (6-SandwichClick)

* **Instructions:**
	* Add in the missing code such that clicking any of the sandwiches causes…

	1. An alert message to popup saying something snarky about the sandwich type.

	2. A second alert message that displays to the user the number of that specific sandwich they’ve eaten.

	* HINT: You will need counter variables.

## Activity - Trigger Random

* **File:**
	* TriggerRandom_UNSOLVED.html (7-TriggerRandom)

* **Instructions:**
	* Add in the missing code such that clicking the big blue button triggers a random number (between 1 and 1000) to be selected and prominently displayed in the randomNumber div.
	
	* Hint: None. You got this.

## Partners: Lottery Generator

* **File:**
	* TriggerRandom_UNSOLVED.html (7-TriggerRandom)

* **Instructions:**
	* Using the code from the previous random number generator as a starting point, create a lottery generator.

	* In our case, the lottery number should pick 9 random numbers (and always 9 numbers). As an example: 886563264.

	* Display this number in the randomNumber div.

	* Then when a user clicks again, have the code create a new row with the latest number at the top. 

## Activity - Extra: NumberChecker

* **Instructions:**
	* Using the displayed application as an example, create code in which:

	* A computer picks a random number between 1 and 4

	* Users then “click” buttons numbered 1 – 4.

	* If the user’s number matches the computer’s number, display text informing them that they won in the Result panel. Otherwise, display text informing them that they lost.

	* If you finish early, try to improve the aesthetics.
