### 3.	Partners Do: Scope Quiz	(0:07)

* **File:**
	* `scopeQuiz_Unsolved.html` (`1-ScopeQuiz`)

* **Instructions:**
	* Spend a few moments studying the codefile with the person sitting next to you.

	* Then run the program in the browser.

	* Once you run the program, you'll find that Code Block 1 leads to different alerts than Code Block 2.

	* Ask your partner which Code Block is behaving the way you would expect.

	* Then work with your partner to try and identify the specific difference that is causing the issue with the faulty block.

	* Once you spot the issue, try to explain to your partner why JavaScript is handling these Code Blocks differently.

### 5.	Partners Do: This Example	(0:10)

* **File:**

	* `this-unsolved.html` (`2-ThisExample`)

* **Instructions:**

	* Using the comments in the guide answer each of the questions asked in the file.

	* Focus your attention on trying to wrap your mind around the concept of "this" and the unique role it can play in code.

	* Then try to explain to your partner how "this" works, focus on the first three examples.

### 7.	Students Do: Cobwebs	(0:10)


* **File:**

	* `cobweb-starter.html` (`3-Cobweb`)

* **Instructions:**

* Create the missing the code such that you can retrieve the requested item from the `theCobWeb` object.

* Note: This exercise is actually very relevant to work as a web developer, as data is often relayed across websites in the form of deeply nested JavaScript objects like this one.

* Bonus: If you finish early, begin pondering the bonus item. This is a **very** challenging exercise. Don't expect us to give you the solution (we won't). It's one of those challenges that will leave you banging your head against the wall.

### 9.	Intro Calculator + Group Formation	(0:10)

* **File:**
	* `jQueryCalculator_Starter.html` (`4-jQueryCalculator.html`)

* **Instructions:**
	* Create the JavaScript logic necessary to add functionality to the jQuery Calculator.

	* Your calculator should be able to handle basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

	* You should be making use of the existing buttons.

	* You should be making use of the existing placeholders for entering content (i.e. "firstNumber", "operator", "secondNumber", "result").

	* You should have fun and push yourselves! This is a challenge activityâ€”which means, if you get it done, you are a King of jQuery. If you don't, no sweat. The important thing is that you learned at least a FEW things along the way.

* **Instructor/TAs:** At this time, you may want to let students know about the 1:1 option available during the exercise. Describe these "catch-up" sessions as being "crash-courses" intended to help students go over the basics. Alternatively, if you already have a good idea of which students need the catch-up sessions, avoid making the announcement completely, and simply invite those students to take advantage of the time.
