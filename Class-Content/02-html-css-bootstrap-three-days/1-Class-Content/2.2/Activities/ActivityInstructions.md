## 2.2 Activity Instructions

# Activity - CSS Typography

**Instructions:**

	* Using the `HTMLTemplate` file provided to you, create an external CSS stylesheet to modify the typography of each of the body paragraphs.  

	* Be sure to modify the following CSS properties for each paragraph of your page:

		* font-family

		* font-size

		* font-weight

		* line-height

	* Hint: You will need to do three things to accomplish this task.

		* Link to a CSS page that you'll make

		* Create classes for each paragraph

		* Add in styles for each class 

	* **Bonus:**

		* If you finish early, read about [TypePlate - http://typeplate.com/](http://typeplate.com/) and see if you can figure out how to incorporate it into your site. 

		* If you still finish early, spend some time trying to actually make the page look nice. Think about what's aesthetically pleasing and push yourself to create it. 

# Activity - Custom Fonts Activity

**Instructions:**

	* Assignment:

		* Create (or re-use) an HTML Document of your choosing and then incorporate 2-3 Custom Google Fonts into the page. 

	* Bonus:

		* If you finish early, read about Font Awesome icons and see if you can figure out how to incorporate one onto your page. 

# Activity - Pseudo Styles

* **Instructions:**

	* Assignment

		* Create a series of links and modify the pseudo-classes associated with their Default, Active, Hover, and Focus States.
		
		* Hint: Nope. No starter code. Gotta do this from scratch :-) 

	* Bonus: 

		* If you finish early, incorporate a pseudo-class we haven’t covered in your page. Then read about “pseudo-elements” and try to incorporate one as well.

		* Slack out the code and screenshot if you end up completing the bonus. 

# Activity Partners Do: Where's the CSS (Answer the Questions)


	* Where is the HTML document drawing its styles from?

	* How does our browser know which element to style in which way? (ex: button face or background banner) 

* Hint: we've used something similar with Google Fonts.


# Activity CSS Bootstrap

* **Instructions:**

	* Working with someone closest to you:

		* Navigate to the Twitter Bootstrap website.

		* Then copy the link to the Bootstrap CSS file into one of your old HTML files.

		* Look through the Bootstrap CSS or Components list and incorporate at least three Bootstrap elements onto your page.

		* Slack a screenshot of your page to your section’s channel when you are done.

		* Hint: First include a link to Bootstrap’s CSS. Then visit the Bootstrap page on CSS or Components. 

	* If you finish early, let the TAs know so you can be sent to help others around you.
