### Activity - Code Dissection 

* **File:** 

	* `JSDissect.html` (`1-CodeDissection.html`)

* **Instructions:**

	* Download the code sent to you via slack. 
	 
	* Open it in Chrome and watch what happens.
	
	* Then open the file in Sublime and try to explain to someone around you how the code connects to the events seen on the page.
	
	* PS: I know we haven’t covered Javascript before…
	
	* MAJOR PS: When downloading any code going forward, be sure to hit “Download”. **If you copy and paste directly from Slack, your code will not work.**

### Activity - Pizza Variables

* **Files:**

	* `PizzaVariables` (`3-PizzaVariables` - UNSOLVED)

* **Instructions:**
	
	* Using the instructions in the file sent to you, fill in the missing Javascript code to create variables.

	* When done, open the file in Chrome and check the output.

	* If you completed the activity correctly, you should see a series of pop-up windows with text inside. 


### Activity - Pizza Console

* **Files:**
	
	* `PizzaConsole` (`05-PizzaConsole` - UNSOLVED)

* **Instructions:**

	* Using the file sent to you as a guide, modify the code such that it uses console.log instead of alerts to display messages. 

	* Then talk to the person closest to you and describe the difference between the two.

### Activity - PromptSushi

* **Files:**

	* `PromptSushi.html` (`07-PromptSushi` - Unsolved)

* **Instructions:**

	* Create code using Javascript that does all of the following:

		* Asks the user with a confirm: “Do you like _____” and store it into a variable.

		* Ask the user “What kind of ________” do you like with a prompt and store that into a variable.

		* Alert both variables to the screen.

### - Activity - Conditionals

* **Files:**
	
	* None

* **Instructions:**

* Create a website (from scratch) that asks users if they eat steak.

* If they respond with "yes" then write the following to the page: “Here’s a Steak Sandwich”

* If they respond with "no" then write the following to the page: “Here’s a tofu stir fry”

* Bonus: Ask what the user’s birth year is. If they are under 21, post: “No Sake for you!” 

* Hint: You will need to use document.write() from a few slides back.

### - Activity - Arrays

* **File:**

	* `arraysactivity.html` (`12-ArraysActivity`)

* **Instructions:**

	* Take a few moments to look over the following file with a partner.

	* Then create a comment line above each console.log() line to “predict” what the output will be.

	* HINT: Comments are the "//" you see with the grayed lines. These are ignored by Javascript and are available so other developers know what you mean when you coded something. Commenting your code is an extremely useful habit to get into as it will also help you better understand the applications you coded when you look back at them.

### Activity - Bands (ExtraChallenge)

* **Instructions:**

	* Create a website that checks if a user's favorite band is one of your favorite bands.

	* If it is one of your favorite bands, then create an alert saying: “YEAH I LOVE THEM”. 

	* If it’s not create an alert saying: “Nah. They’re pretty lame”

	* Hint:  You will need to research how to use .indexOf() 

	* Hint: You will need to research how to use .toLowerCase()
