# Activity - Array Building

* **File:**

	* `LoopTV_Unsolved.html` (`1-LoopTV`)

* **Instructions:**

	* Run the program sent to you via slack. 

	* Then, with a partner, fill in the missing comments for each line of code. 

	* Make sure both of you can fully explain what each line means. 

	* Be prepared to share with the class!

* **File:**

	* `MyFirstFunctions_Unsolved.html` (`3-MyFirstFunctions`)

# Activity - My First Functions


* **Instructions:**

	* Working in pairs and using the starter file sent to you via slack – fill in the missing functions and function calls.

	* Note: Try to finish all four functions if you can but don’t beat yourself up if you only get 1 or 2. The important thing is that you get at least one function fully done.

	* Hint: Look back the example just slacked to you. 

* **File:**

		* `carObject_Unsolved.html` (`7-MyFirstObject`)

	* **Instructions:**

	* With a partner, spend the next few moments studying the code just slacked to you. 

	* Fill in the missing comments to log the relevant information about the provided `car` object.

	* Bonus: If you finish early, begin creating an object of your own in HTML. Slack out a snippet of the code to the class when you are done. Be Creative!

# Activity - Basic Objects


* **Instructions:**

	* Using the code sent to you from the previous activity as a starting point, create a complete application such that:

		* Users can enter keyboard input (letters)

		* These letters then trigger the car’s functions to get run

		* These letters also trigger a global function called reWriteStats() that logs the car’s make, model, color, mileage, and isWorking status to the console.

		* HINT: Look into the document.onkeyup() function to help you collect user input from the keyboard.

# Activity - Run that Car

* **Instructions:**

	* Using the code sent to you from the previous activity as a starting point, create a complete application such that:

		* Users can enter keyboard input (letters)

		* These letters then trigger the car’s functions to get run

		* These letters also trigger a global function called reWriteStats() that logs the car’s make, model, color, mileage, and isWorking status to the console.

		* HINT: Look into the document.onkeyup() function to help you collect user input from the keyboard.

# Activity - Extra - T/F Game 

* **Instructions:**

* Starting from a blank HTML file:

	* Create an object with 10 questions. The object should be structured like this: q1: [“QUESTION”, “ANSWER”]	q2: [“QUESTION”, “ANSWER”]

	* Then create code that goes through the questions one by one and asks users each question. Users must hit t (for true) or f (for false).

	* Check the user’s answer against the correct answer and provide the user with an alert of some sort telling them if they are right or wrong. 

	* Bonus: Keep track of the number of questions the user gets right or wrong.

	* Hint: Don’t worry about having DRY code to start with. Just focus on getting working
