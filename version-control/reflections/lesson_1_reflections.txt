How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Fewer lines of code to go through.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Referencing back or reverting to a previous version as needed will save time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Allows you to save changes when they are logically ready to save.  Git was made for saving code versions.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They are designed for different purposes.  One works better for some things than the ohters and vice versa.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the history of the commits while git diff points out the changes between selected commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always revert to a previous unchanged version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to understand more what it can be used for.
